Watch &amp; Learn: Amino Acids

This watchface shows the front face of a flashcard displaying the 20 common amino acids at physiological pH. At a flick of the wrist, the user can see the back face of the flashcard: information about each amino acid including the full name, 3-letter name, polar/nonpolar, ion characterization, and pKa of the side chain if applicable. The residues change every 15 seconds.
