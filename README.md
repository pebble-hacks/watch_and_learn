Watch &amp; Learn
This watchface shows the front face of a flashcard displaying the common amino acids at physiological pH. At a flick of the wrist, the user can see the information about each amino acid, including the full name, 3-letter name, hydrophobicity, ion characterization, and pKa of the side chain if applicable. The residues change every 15 seconds.
